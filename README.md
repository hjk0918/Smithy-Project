This is a year 1 physical prototyping project involving CAD design, 3D print, linkage, 3D reconstruction, mobile App and Arduino.
I created a scene of a traditional smithy. When the system is turned on, the blacksmith starts to strike the unfinished sword with a hammer. The air blower pumps air into the forge while the fire inside the forge is flickering (lighted up by LED) and jumping up and down. The driven motor can be tele-controlled by an Android App with either touching and motion detection.


## Mechanism

The mechanical motion system consists of three parts, the blacksmith, the air blower and the forge. Each part is an extension from four-bar linkage, designed by me. I separately designed each single mechanism, and then combined them all together with gears, so that it can be driven by one motor.
